### Project Title
Bikeshare data exploration script

### Description
[Bikeshare](https://www.bikeshare.com) is a bike-sharing system active in many cities across the USA.

We have created an interactive script which allows the user to navigate through the rental data in three cities (Chicago, New York and Washington) and answer questions about the rentals in those cities in different periods.

The user can use the following filters:
* city
* month
* week
and it will get statistics about the given place and time. This statistics will be information about favorite routes, duration of travels etc.

### Files used
1. bikeshare.py
2. chicago.csv
3. new_york_city.csv
4. washington.csv
